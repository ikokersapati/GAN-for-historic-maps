# GAN-for-historic-maps
This project enables you to work on historic maps collections using data science application of machine learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The objective of these operations is to translate the curated historic maps into sattelite images so they can be utilised further for other works for a wide range of researchers (e. g., historians, archeologists, geographers, anthropologists, etc.).
The initial example of work on google maps is presented by Jason Brownlee on this [page](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-pix2pix-gan-for-image-to-image-translation/) and the dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4lxekwy98c0oyp9k6noux/maps.tar.gz?dl=0&rlkey=bcpqqe7bpj8wo1zmg6poysbl9).
The early example of GAN leverage for historic maps was made by Andrade, et al. (2020).
The code is presented for Jupyter Notebook script.
