# GAN-for-historic-maps
This project enables you to work on historic maps collections using data science application of machine learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The objective of these operations is to translate the curated historic maps into sattelite images so they can be utilised further for other works for a wide range of researchers (e. g., historians, archeologists, geographers, anthropologists, etc.).
The initial example of dataset is presented on the https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-pix2pix-gan-for-image-to-image-translation/.
The early example of GAN leverage for historic maps was made by Andrade, et al. (2020) (the pdf is attached).
The code is presented for Jupyter Notebook script.
